Hello
Using contours to get the object(square,circle,star etc) 0 contour.py
Using matchshapes to get the shape. matchShape.py

P.S this is very primitive. 
Looking forward use k-means or other mlt techniques

modpx.py is an exercise to learn numpy indexing. for OCR. and binarizing. 

OCR Modules - 
Added blur funtions and erosion dilation etc. 

Working on removing the O from the star. K means is used to binarize the image. But not enough. 

Thats why working with erosion and blur modules. 

Using erosion and contours the shape object is tracked easily. 

Shape detect? - What do we use for OCR in to detect shapes?
